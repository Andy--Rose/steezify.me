"Make some noise, Branstag!" You could hear the main floor DJ three blocks away. That also happened to be the start of the line to get into Korb, Branstags premier nightclub. Brexan had planned to meet some friends there, but they bailed at the last minute. Branstag was full of the egotistical and self-centered; Brexan had no intention of going to Korb solo. Full of energy and ready to live life to the fullest, he started walking with no destination and no telling where the night would take him.<br><br>After walking for some time, Brexan heard a distant rhythmic thumping. 'There are no clubs in this area' he thought to himself, but he couldn't deny the existence of the sounds and decided to investigate. A block went by and the pounding bass became louder. He came to an alley, which was surely the source. Yet there were no flashing lights, no lines, and no people in sight. There was no club here, but the music was undeniable.<br><br>Branstag was not the place to venture into a dark alley at night. Everyone on the planet of Vermos knew that. They also know that a Vermosian should never walk into a Marcusian club, even if by mistake. Brandstag is the biggest city on Vermos, filled with big business and commerce. Though Brandstag was a known hotbed for crime and corruption, everything on Vermos seemed to revolve around the big city. <br><br>The building on the left of the alley belonged to a bank, closed for the weekend by Vermos law. The building on the right of the alley was under renovations and had no occupants. Vacant as it seemed, it was clear that something was happening down that alley and Brexan knew that he had a choice to make.<br><br>Maybe it was fate; Maybe it was the little voice inside his head; Maybe it was a boost of confidence from the last bottle of blork. Whatever pushed him that night, Brexan decided to continue his journey and headed into the alley.<br><br>Halfway down the alley Brexan could feel the vibrations from the bass shifting the hairs on his arms, indicating that he was getting close. To the right he saw a small gap between the alley and the building, a hidden staircase. He had come this far and was not about to turn back now. Without hesitation, down the stairs he went. <br><br>The door was shut and there were still no signs. 'Do I knock?' he thought. Putting his hand on the door, Brexan could feel the pulsing music vibrating, almost as if it were begging him to enter. Grabbing the handle, he slowly started to open the door when it suddenly burst towards him! The force was strong enough to bump him into the concrete wall at the bottom of the stairs. <br><br>Two Vermosian men came through the door laughing, as if in the middle of a conversation. When they saw Brexan against the wall, one hollered out, "Hey man, in or out. No standing in the alley." Brexan smiled and nodded as they continued to walk away. Once again he approached the door, this time swiftly and with confidence, and walked into the building's sub-level.<br><br>Brexan was instantly engulfed by a foreign atmosphere. The music was pumping through his entire body, blasting from the speaker stacks in front of the DJ. The room was dark with lasers and spotlights bouncing off the walls in every direction. The ceilings were low and the small space was packed. There was a distinct musk from the old abandoned building combined with the dense air of the crowded space of around 100 ravers, Vermosian and Marcusians alike.<br><br>Within the first few steps of the entrance there was a sense of oneness among the people in the room. There were no barriers between species, race or gender as everyone bounced to the same beat. It was like the music was bringing everyone together as a single entity through purposeful rhythms and heart-stopping bass. There was a void of commercialism and posh that was filled with a raw and unfiltered environment.<br><br>Shortly after getting settled next to the wall to further observe his surroundings, Brexan was approached by a goofy yet friendly looking Marcusion. "You are new here. Want a blork?" said the stranger. Brexan replied "Sure! I'm Brexan." The man smiled, passing the drink and said "I'm Marlo".<br><br><br>Marlo wore thick glasses and was short for a Marcusian, which are typically quite a bit taller than Vermosians. Disregarding his uncommanding physique, he was tactfully dressed and looked to fit the part in this basement party. It soon became clear that Marlo was deeply involved in Branstag's underground scene as was happy to show Brexan the ropes. This was truly a night that Brexan would never forget.
