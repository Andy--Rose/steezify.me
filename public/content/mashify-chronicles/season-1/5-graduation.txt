A week went by after Brexan and Trel were conned and locked up. Brexan tried repeatedly to get in touch with Marlo, but he was not picking up. This was strange because after returning from jail and charging the battery on his phone, Brexan was greeted with over a dozen missed calls from Marlo. He wanted to find out just how the hell he ended up in jail and get Marlo’s side of the story. With the weekend approaching, Brexan had just about given up altogether on Marlo. ‘Screw it. I will give him one more chance.’ Brexan thought to himself. This time Marlo answered the call. <br /><br />“Brexan, my friend! How are you?” <br /><br />“Marlo! You are alive! Where have you been?”<br /><br />“It has been a rough week. I heard about what happened to you two. When I confronted Krasim about it, he said it was all a misunderstanding and he would go to the department and get it cleared up. I tried to call, thinking that you would have been released. When you didn’t answer or return my calls, I knew something was up. It turns out that Krasim had vanished without a trace.”<br /><br /><br /><br />“That asshole! Did you end up finding him?”<br /><br /><br /><br />“No, but the authorities are still looking. Apparently, they have been chasing him for some time. Unfortunately, I was helping him buy that Warehouse. Or I thought I was. He ran off with half of my savings and I have been trying to track him down all week. All I have found out is that his name is not Krasim and, as far as the authorities know, he is not from Vermos.”<br /><br />“Wow, Marlo I’m sorry to hear that. Are you going to be alright?”<br /><br />“I’ll be fine, but I should be the one apologizing to you guys! Three days in jail is worse than losing a bit of money. I am sorry for getting you into that situation.”<br /><br />It was true, if it weren’t for Marlo, they likely would have never ended up getting in involved with the man they knew as Krasim. But without meeting Marlo, Brexan would have missed out on many other experiences. The conversation continued on for a while. Marlo was not at fault for what had happened, but clearly his trusting personality hampered his ability to judge character. While their friendship with Marlo would continue, Brexan and Trel would never have the same level of trust with him again.<br /><br />After their time being locked up, Brexan and Trel decided to focus on finishing school rather than continuing to pursue social emersion. At the time of the incident, they were in the final quarter-year of classes before graduating. They both had the desire to put school behind them and move forward with their lives. They still went to parties on the weekend, but at this point was more about making lasting memories with the connections they had made in school rather than experiencing new cultures.<br /><br />The thought of life after school weighed heavy on Brexan’s mind. With his degree in technology, finding a job would be relatively easy. However, he was still unsure on how or where he wanted to start his career. He did not have long to decide. Brexan had no savings and no home to return to while searching for a job. Brexan’s mom died in a car accident just four years prior. His dad had a melt down and killed the driver of the other vehicle, landing himself a spot on the prison planet of Braygon.<br /><br />Trel on the other hand could go home to Molarre, a remote suburb of Branstag. With his degree in Cultural Studies, Trel always had plans to become a teacher. In fact, his mom had a connection for an opportunity lined up for him in Molarre. That topic was something that both Trel and Brexan were dreading, so they rarely talked about it. They had always been inseparable. Neither of them wanted to think about parting ways. <br /><br />There was no time to think about the future during finals week. They had been studying relentlessly for a month. After the last final, Brexan and Trel were keen to celebrate with their classmates. They had made it! There was a school sponsored graduate function in the evening at the recreation building at the end of finals week. It was not the sort of event that Brexan and Trel would normally attend, but they decided it would be a good way to make some last minute connections. They dressed up in their nicest clothes, which were obviously purchased on a student budget, and headed off to the event.<br /><br />When they entered, Brexan and Trel glanced at each other, both expressing a look of uncertainty. It was about what they expected. Boring music barely audible over the voices of the crowded room, an unimpressive food spread, and no open bar. One would think after all of the money they had forked over to the university over the last 4 years, the least they could do is throw a decent party. There were round tables spread about the room for people to stand around and talk. They gathered some food from the buffet and posted up at an empty table. This was not their scene and they were not sure where to start.<br /><br />Shortly after finding an empty table, one of Trel’s culture professors joined them. He seemed to sense their discomfort. Brexan and Trel felt more at ease with the situation once the professor explained that everyone was there for the same reason they were. “Alburt! Over here!” The professor waved to his friend who seemed to have just wrapped up a conversation. “Alburt was one of my students back when he was in school,” noted the professor. <br /><br />Alburt was a stalky Marcussian who looked to be in his late thirties. He was wearing a uniform for the Grammos Alliance of Peace, also known as GAP. The organization was responsible for maintaining peace across worlds in the Grammos galaxy. Unlike police or military, GAP balanced it outreach between maintaining peace, discovery, and helping those in need. For every credit spent on the military, equal credit was spent on the support of the galaxy and its inhabitants. <br /><br />Alburt seemed right at home at this sort of event. He was a recruiter for GAP and an alumni of Makilar University. He carried a swagger of confidence and was very interested to learn about Brexan and Trel. He asked about what the studied, what their goals were, and what plans they had after finishing school. Alburt sensed their insecurity about what happens next and seemed to think they would be a great fit for GAP. <br /><br />Brexan and Trel never really considered joining GAP. From how Alburt described it, GAP actually seemed like a viable option for Brexan. The minimum two year commitment required for GAP meant that he would have a home in their facilities while he could save money. They would also pay his student loans from Makilar. For Brexan, this represented an opportunity for stability when he was about to lose it. They exchanged contact information with Alburt and he was off to the next group of students. During the rest of the event, they talked to more professors, some colleges, and a couple of recruiters from large companies. They came out of the event feeling more confident about their options coming out of school.<br /><br />The following week, Brexan and Trel had their graduation ceremony in the Makilar Auditorium. The stands were packed with family and friends. As the recession music played and they found their seats, Trel found his parents in the stands and waved to them vigorously. Brexan waved too as they were the closest thing he had to parents now. As the ceremony went on and the speakers came to the stage one after another, Brexan began feeling a sense of finality. After everyone had received their diplomas, a final cheer of celebration resounded as everyone threw their caps up.  For Brexan, this signified that he was finally moving on.<br /><br />After the ceremony, Trel’s parents took them out for a celebration dinner. It wasn’t long after they were seated before his mom started talking about the opportunity waiting for Trel in Molarre. “Have you talked to Yelma yet? They are very excited to hear from you,” said Trel’s mom. Yelma was a private secondary school, well known for being one of the top schools in the greater Branstag area. Trel squirmed uncomfortably before hanging his head and answering the question. <br /><br />“No, I haven’t reached out.” <br /><br />His mom scoffed and replied in a tone that clearly expressed her frustration. <br /><br />“You needed to do that weeks ago! What are thinking? You are going to lose the opportunity of a lifetime!”<br /><br />“I don’t want to do it!” Trel stated loudly. Both Trel’s mom and Brexan were both stunned. Having grabbed the attention of the table, and likely several others, Trel continued. “I am not ready to start a long term position. I want to see the world! I want to see other worlds! I want to experience more of what life has to offer before settling down in a suburb.”<br /><br />His mom looked disappointed as she hung her head and fiddled with her napkin. Finally, Trel’s dad decided to break his silence. “Son, I think you are making a good decision.” She looked at him and scoffed again, obviously feeling betrayed by her spouse. “If you choose this path before you are ready, you will never be content in life. You need to follow your heart.” Trel’s mom looked to her husband with tears in her eyes. His words had clearly resonated with her. “You father is right.”<br /><br />They finished off dinner and said their goodbyes before Brexan and Trel headed back to their apartment to get ready for that night. <br /><br />“Trel. I had no idea you were not interested in the Yelma opportunity,” said Brexan. <br /><br />“Honestly, neither did I until I said it out loud to my mom. I was seriously considering taking the opportunity.” <br /><br />“What changed your mind?”<br /><br />“When we were talking to Alburt the other day, it got me thinking. There are so many paths in life to take. How do we make the right decision? Honestly, before that conversation, I hadn’t really given thought to other careers.”<br /><br />“But you have always wanted to be a teacher. Do you just want to teach somewhere else first and get some experience?”<br /><br />Trel shook his head and smiled. “How can I teach kids when all I know is what is in the books? The people we really learn from in life are not the ones telling you what is in a book, but the people writing them. There is more I want to experience and learn before I start teaching.”<br /><br />“So what are you going to do?” asked Brexan. He knew what he wanted the answer to be. He was already strongly considering joining GAP as it was pretty much his only option. If Trel joined him, he knew that it would be the ultimate adventure. “I have given that some thought,” said Trel, his smile now ranging ear to ear. “Do you want to join GAP with me?” “Yes!” Brexan exclaimed before Trel could finish his sentence. <br /><br />The night of graduation would be one Brexan and Trel would remember forever. They bounced around from party to party visiting all of their friends, some of which they knew they would probably not see again or at least for a very long time. Many people were sobbing and giving hugs. While Brexan and Trel were sad to be leaving their colleagues, they were both beyond excited to be moving on together.<br /><br />The following day, after waking up in the late afternoon and nursing their hangovers, Brexan and Trel made a call to Arthur to talk to him more about signing up with GAP. Arthur told them all about the various sectors in GAP, depending on the career they wanted to pursue. He also mentioned that if they were going to the same sector, they could sign up together and remain together at least through the duration of their first two year minimum contract. <br /><br />That night they went through the options. Brexan, having a technology degree, could work in any of the sectors. Trel on the other hand was more limited with his degree in Cultural Studies. They both were interested in working on a space vessel and experiencing new cultures and worlds. After narrowing down the options, they both agreed that a position in the Exploration sector would be their best option. The Exploration sector was charged with finding and monitoring new planets, mapping the galaxy and searching for other intelligent life that could join the Alliance.<br /><br />The next morning, Brexan and Trel dressed in their nice clothes to head for the GAP registration office. It was a nice day and the office was not too far, so they decided to walk. As they walked, the gravity of the decision began to set in. Two years was a long commitment. “What did you tell your parents?” Brexan asked. Trel replied, his voice shaking slightly at the thought of it, “I am not going to tell them until after we sign up.” It made sense. They would definitely not be happy with the decision and it is easier to ask for forgiveness than permission. <br /><br />When they arrived at the office, they were asked to take a number. The place was packed with students applying. It suddenly occurred to Brexan that there might actually be competition to get into the program. Finally their number was called and they both went to the desk together to register. With some words of encouragement from the registrar, they left the office confident in their decision. <br /><br />Later that day Trel told his parents. To his surprise, they were supportive. They agreed it would be a great opportunity to see new places and gain experience. They also knew the dangers and wanted to spend time with him before he started, so Trel went home to be with his parents. Though Brexan was also invited, he decided to stay in Branstag and wait for word on their new adventure. He didn’t want to get in the way of their family time. <br /><br />After anxiously waiting for a week, they finally got a letter in the mail. They were both accepted and assigned to the same ship in the Exploration sector. Their ship was named the Evermore and was led by Captain Stranin Dubtree. They were required to move into the barracks over the next week for six months of Initiation Training. Their next adventure was about to begin. <br /><br />
